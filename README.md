# Getting Started with the Challenge

This is a simple React application created using **create-react-app**. I used **styled-components** for the styling of the application.

## Start the app

```
npm i
npm start
```

## Notes

There is a backend provided that will log the emails as well as the joke, if i would have more time i would use NodeMailer in the backend to finish the email sending functionality.
